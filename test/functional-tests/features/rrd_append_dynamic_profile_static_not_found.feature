Feature: Remote Debugger Append Request Missing Issuetype

  Scenario: Verify remote debugger process is running
    Given the remote debugger process is not running
    When I start the remote debugger process
    Then the remote debugger process should be running

  Scenario: Send WebPA event for Issuetype Test.TestRun1_apnd and verify logs
    Given the remote debugger is running
    When I trigger the event "Device.DeviceInfo.X_RDKCENTRAL-COM_RFC.Feature.RDKRemoteDebugger.IssueType"
    Then the logs should contain "SUCCESS: Message sending Done"
    Then the logs should be seen with "SUCCESS: Message Reception Done"
    And the issuetype request should match between Send and Receive

  Scenario: Verify the Issuetype is found in dynamic profile
    Given the remote debugger received the message from RBUS command
    When the remotedebugger read the json file form the dynamic path
    Then remotedebugger json read and parse should be success in dynamic path

  Scenario: Verify the Issuetype is not found in static profile
    Given the remote debugger received the message from RBUS command
    When the remotedebugger static json profile is present
    Then remotedebugger should read the Json file
    And remotedebugger logs should contain the Json File Parse Success
    And remotedebugger should log as the Issue requested is not found in the profile
    And issuetype is not found in static json and abort command execution
